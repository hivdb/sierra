/**

 * The rules are specified in an XML schema and interpreted using a high-level language
 *   we developed called an Algorithm Specification Interface (ASI)
 * This class is called when we are interested in the ANRS algorithm. Although the ASI
 *   is meant to be agnostic to the specific set of rules or algorithm, it is easier to
 *   parse the results of the ASI when we know whether the rules comprise conditions that evaluate
 *   to true or false (the case for ANRS) vs. conditions that evaluate to scores (the case for HIVDB)
 *
 * Data structures:
 *   drugLevels: drugName=>level
