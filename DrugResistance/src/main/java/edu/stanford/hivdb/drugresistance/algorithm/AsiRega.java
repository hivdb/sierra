 *   we developed called an Algorithm Specification Interface (ASI)
 * This class is called when we are interested in the Rega algorithm. Although the ASI
 *   is meant to be agnostic to the specific set of rules or algorithm, it is easier to
 *   parse the results of the ASI when we know whether the rules comprise conditions that evaluate
 *   to true or false or conditions that evaluate to scores. The Rega algorithm has examples of both.
 *
 * Data structures:
 *   drugLevels: drugName=>level
